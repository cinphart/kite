_kite_ is an Emacs package that allows you to inspect and
debug an HTML page running in a WebKit browser (along with any
associated resources, such as scripts and stylesheets.)

# Introduction

## Supported Browsers

_kite_ uses the
[WebKit remote debugging protocol](http://www.webkit.org/blog/1620/webkit-remote-debugging/).

This means that your WebKit browser needs to support and have remote
debugging enabled.  At the time of this writing only few browsers
support remote debugging and it has to be enabled explicitly.

### Chrome / Chromium
